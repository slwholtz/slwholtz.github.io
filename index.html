                    <h3>History of Antisemitism</h3>
                    <p>Throughout history, Jews were commonly used as scapegoats for bad situations such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The crucification of Jesus</li>
                        <li>The bubonic plague</li>
                        <li>Germany's loss of WWI</li>

                    <h3>Background of October 7th</h3>
                    <p>On October 7th, 2023, Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel, killing thousands and kidnapping many Israeli citizens.</p>
                    <p>Israel responded by declaring war on Hamas and launching missiles and ground operations in Gaza, killing over 33,000 palestinians, and displacing over 1.7 million Gazans.</p>
                    <p>Israel's response prompted lots of backlash in the US, specifically among the younger generation.</p>
                    <p>Warped perceptions and prejudice cause many people to point fingers regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, resulting in a huge increase in antisemitism and islamophobia.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="current">
                    <h3>Current Day Antisemitism on College Campuses</h3>
                    <p>According to <a href="">hillel.org</a>, there has been a total of 1,487 antisemetic incedents on college campuses since October 7th.</p>
                    <p>The huge increase of anti-Israel and pro-palestine protesting has resulted in prejudice against jews to surface in ways people may not realize is antisemetic. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endevor. This downplays the beliefs of many Jews who have a historic and spiritual connection to the land of Israel.</li>
                        <li>Comparing Israeli policy to the Nazis</li>
                        <li>Holding Jews Collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel</li>
                        <li>Supporting Hamas: Hamas has many articles within its charter that are antisemetic, such as Article 7 calling for the murder of Jews, and article 22 saying Jews are schemers and have control of the world media.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="antizionism">
                    <h3>The Difference Between Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism</h3>
                    <p>Anti-Zionism is the belief that Israel should not exist.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the lines of antisemitism and anti-Zionism cross, but they are not necessarily the same.</p>
                    <p>When you start to blame the Jewish people for the actions of Israel, it shows prejudice and hatred for Jews, not just for Israel.</p>
                    <p>You can be anti-Zionist and critical of Israel without being antisemitic, despite many saying otherwise.</p>
