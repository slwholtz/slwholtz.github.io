                    <h3>Background of October 7th</h3>
                    <p>On October 7th, 2023, Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel, killing thousands and kidnapping many Israeli citizens.</p>
                    <p>Israel responded by declaring war on Hamas and launching missiles and ground operations in Gaza, killing over 33,000 palestinians, and displacing over 1.7 million Gazans.</p>
                    <p>Israel's response prompted lots of backlash in the US, specifically among the younger generation.</p>
                    <p>Warped perceptions and prejudice cause many people to point fingers regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, resulting in a huge increase in antisemitism and islamophobia.</p>

                    <h3>Current Day Antisemitism on College Campuses</h3>
                    <p>According to <a href="https://www.hillel.org/antisemitism-on-college-campuses-incident-tracking-from-2019-2023/" target="_blank">hillel.org</a>, there has been a total of 1,487 antisemetic incedents on college campuses since October 7th.</p>
                    <p>The huge increase of anti-Israel and pro-palestine protesting has resulted in prejudice against jews to surface in ways people may not realize is antisemetic. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endevor. This downplays the beliefs of many Jews who have a historic and spiritual connection to the land of Israel.</li>
                        <li>Comparing Israeli policy to the Nazis</li>
                        <li>Holding Jews Collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel</li>
                        <li>Supporting Hamas: Hamas has many articles within its charter that are antisemetic. For example, "The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him" (<a href="embassies.gov.il/holysee/AboutIsrael/the-middle-east/Pages/The%20Hamas-Covenant.aspx#:~:text=The%20Hamas%20charter%20is%20the,18%20years%20of%20its%20existence" target="_blank">article 7</a>).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Difference Between Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism</h3>
                    <p>Anti-Zionism is the belief that Israel should not exist.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the lines of antisemitism and anti-Zionism cross, but they are not necessarily the same.</p>
                    <p>When you start to blame the Jewish people for the actions of Israel, it shows prejudice and hatred for Jews, not just for Israel.</p>
                    <p>You can be anti-Zionist and critical of Israel without being antisemitic, despite many saying otherwise.</p>
